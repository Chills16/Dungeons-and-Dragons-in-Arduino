# Dungeons-and-Dragons-in-Arduino
This program simulates a simple version of the Dungeons & Dragons game, which is played on the Arduino. The game simulates dice throws, where the player can choose which dice to throw (with how many sides) with 1st button, how many times the dice will be thrown with button 2, and the third button simulates the dice throw, where while the button is held down, a simple animation is shown to signify dice throws, and upon release, a random number is generated - which is the sum of all the dice throws. The program incorporates all 3 buttons, as well as the display to show the animation of the dice throw and the resulting sum of the dice throw values. The code avoids any blocking functions, uses randomized seeding for the selection of the dice values, and uses millis function to keep track of time in needed sections.
